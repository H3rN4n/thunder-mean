## Commapp Client App.
JavaScript Stack construido con Express, AngularJS, and Node.js proveyendo resultados a travez de la colección con la Api de Commapp.

## ¿Como ejecutar la aplicación?
Tener instalados las siguientes aplicaciones.
* Node.js - [Bajar e instalar Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Ruby - [Bajar e instalar Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Bower - [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) para instalar las dependencias de front-end. Se debe instalar globalmente a travez de npm.

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install grunt globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

* Sass - You're going to use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to compile CSS during your grunt task. Make sure you have ruby installed, and then install Sass using gem install:

```bash
$ gem install sass
```

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
## Clonar el repositorio

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/commapp/....
```


## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

* explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration, execute grunt as follows:

```bash
$ grunt prod
```

* explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options

### Running with User Seed
To have default account(s) seeded at runtime:

In Development:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true grunt
```
It will try to seed the users 'user' and 'admin'. If one of the user already exists, it will display an error message on the console. Just grab the passwords from the console.

In Production:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true grunt prod
```
This will seed the admin user one time if the user does not already exist. You have to copy the password from the console and save it.

### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh
```

Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.

Finally, execute grunt's prod task `grunt prod`
* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`


## Testing Your Application
You can run the full test suite included with MEAN.JS with the test task:

```bash
$ grunt test
```

This will run both the server-side tests (located in the app/tests/ directory) and the client-side tests (located in the public/modules/*/tests/).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```bash
$ grunt test:server
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```bash
$ grunt test:client
```
